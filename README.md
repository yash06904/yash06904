### About Me

I did my Master's in Engineering from Indian Institute of Science in 2011. After that I worked as Senor Lead Engineer in Qualcomm and as principal product Engineer in cadence design systems close to 10 years. Currently I am pursuing Ph.D under Dr. Anirban Chakraborty in field of Federated Learning with applications to computer vision at Department of Computational and Data Sciences in Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. Link to my RESUME is [here](https://github.com/yash06904/yash06904/blob/88e9820d06035a93e721c9498171042a6548f345/yashwanth_resume_one_page.pdf) [/embed]  

**Projects**
- Scene Graph Generation:
Scene Graph (SG) classification predicts objects and the
relations between the objects in the image given the bounding
boxes, in this work we explore the applications of Graph
Neural Networks and the Knowledge Graph statistics for
Scene Graph Classification, we evaluate the performance
on the visual genome data set.


- Federated Learning by matching activation statistics:
In this work we propose a new regularization method at client side for training
neural networks in a Federated setup, where server samples the the edge models for
training and these updates are aggregated at server, different from prior works this
technique can be integrated with any of the sate of the art approaches like FedDyn,
SCAFFOLD etc to further enhance the performance. We show the effectiveness of
the approach using the empirical experiments performed on real world data sets
such as CIFAR10,CIFAR100. We show empirically by augmenting the approach
with the existing algorithms the performance can be boosted significantly on these
Datasets
