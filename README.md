After that I worked as Senor Lead Engineer in Qualcomm and as principal product Engineer in cadence design systems close to 10 years. Currently I am pursuing Ph.D under Dr. Anirban Chakraborty in field of Federated Learning with applications to computer vision at Department of Computational and Data Sciences in Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore.
