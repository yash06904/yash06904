In this project we analyze the data from the https://data.gov.in/ where we take the data on the court trials in India we use the file 'NCRB_CII-2020_Table.No-18B.2.csv

In the above figure, on x-axis we plot the number of cases that resulted in conviction and on the y-axis we plot the total number of trials that are completed.
We observe the postive correlation among these two features. This implies that conviction is prportinal to the trails completed.
